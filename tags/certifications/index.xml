      <description>People play day trader with their life. And expect long term gains. How do I know this? Because I have been there.
Lately I have been working on learning a new job, losing weight, raising my kids, and spending time with my wife. Everything I listed it important. But has made it challenging to prepare for the AWS Solutions Architect certification. So, rather than complain. I thought back to my core principle on how to be successful in anything #LabEveryday.</description>

      <description>Over the pass 4 years I have used certifications to elevate my career and skills. They have helped me to get opportunities that I use to only dream about. Not only that, but they have boosted my income to levels that I never thought that I could reach in tech.
But don&amp;rsquo;t get it twisted! Not every certification journey I have had has not been all roses and Hennessey. Yo boy has failed A LOT!</description>
